Upcoming Policy Change: Disable Command Invoke on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Clusters

Dear Team,

As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the security and compliance of our cloud infrastructure, we will be disabling the "Command Invoke" feature on all Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.

ðŸ”’ Whatâ€™s Changing?
The ability to remotely execute commands using Azureâ€™s kubectl run-command (also known as "Command Invoke") will be disabled across all AKS clusters.

ðŸ—“ Effective Date: [Insert Date]
This change will be rolled out gradually, and we recommend that any workflows depending on this feature be reviewed and updated before the cutoff.

ðŸ’¡ Why This Change?

To reduce potential security exposure by limiting remote command execution.

To align with industry best practices for Kubernetes cluster hardening.

To ensure tighter control over cluster access and operations.

âœ… What You Need to Do:

Review your current AKS usage and identify any dependencies on Command Invoke.

Migrate to alternative methods such as using kubectl via bastion hosts or CI/CD pipelines with appropriate RBAC.

Reach out to the DevOps team if you need support in updating your processes.
