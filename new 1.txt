"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today, I’ll be presenting a quick update about the General Availability (GA) of Azure Monitor Managed Prometheus for Azure Kubernetes Service, also known as AKS.

✅ What’s New?
We’re excited to share that Azure Monitor now provides a fully managed Prometheus experience.
This means you no longer need to manually deploy, scale, or maintain your own Prometheus infrastructure—it’s all handled by Microsoft, directly integrated with AKS.

🌟 Key Benefits
Let’s look at the three main advantages:

Managed & Scalable:
The service automatically scales with your workloads. It’s maintained by Microsoft, so you can focus on your applications rather than the monitoring setup.

Native Integration:
It integrates directly with Azure Monitor and works seamlessly with Grafana dashboards.
This simplifies telemetry collection and supports Prometheus metrics scraping out of the box for AKS workloads.

Secure by Default:
Azure handles security through managed identities and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), ensuring your metrics are only accessible by authorized users.

🚀 How to Get Started
Right now, Azure Monitor Managed Prometheus can be enabled using Bicep or Terraform.

(Optional: You can briefly mention if your team uses these tools or plans to implement them.)

⚠️ Important Note
Please note that enabling via Azure Portal is currently not supported, due to a policy enforcement. So, infrastructure-as-code is the way to go here.
