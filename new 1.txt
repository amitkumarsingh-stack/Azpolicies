We are temporarily removing the deny policy for the AKS Invoke command due to an issue we are currently facing with the azurerm provider during AKS resource updates.

The issue arises when Terraform attempts to update an existing AKS resource. During the plan phase, it identifies parameters that require updating. However, during the actual update operation, it does not send all the required parameters, causing the operation to fail.

ðŸ”§ To mitigate this, we are switching the policy effect from Deny to Audit mode for now. This will allow necessary operations to proceed while we work on resolving the underlying issue.

Once the issue is fixed, we will revert the policy effect back to Deny to maintain compliance.

Please reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
