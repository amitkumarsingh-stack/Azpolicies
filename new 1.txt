This policy was triggered because your Azure Monitor Workspace does not have a Private Endpoint connection, or the connection is not in an Approved state.

To remediate this policy violation, please follow these steps:

Navigate to your Azure Monitor Workspace in the Azure portal.

Go to the Networking section, then click on Private Access.

Check for an existing Private Endpoint and review its Connection State.

If no Private Endpoint exists, please create one.

Ensure that the connection status shows as “Approved”.

Once the Private Endpoint is in place and approved, the policy should no longer flag the resource.
