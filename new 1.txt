I hope this message finds you well.

While reviewing the built-in policy "Disable Command Invoke on AKS Cluster," we noticed that it currently references an outdated API version (2023-11-01). This version does not support several important parameters commonly used in modern AKS configurationsâ€”such as identity, OMSAgent, and enablePrivateCluster.

Due to this limitation, we were required to clone and modify the policy manually to accommodate these parameters. However, relying on a custom version introduces risk: if Microsoft updates the original policy or alters the behavior of the AKS API, our customized version may become outdated or incompatible.

We kindly request that Microsoft update this built-in policy to use a more recent AKS API version that supports these essential parameters. Doing so would improve policy alignment with current AKS deployment practices and reduce the need for custom policy management.

Thank you for your attention and continued support.
