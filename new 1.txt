Let me walk you through a recent update regarding our Sentinel Policy.

Weâ€™ve made an important adjustment to the Azure Policy that controls Diagnostic Settings. This policy is responsible for sending all relevant logs to CISO Detect.

ðŸ”§ Why this change?
This update is driven by the goal of improving cost efficiency. Weâ€™re now removing unnecessary logging for components like:

kube-audit-admin

kube-scheduler

cluster-autoscaler

These were previously being logged to the sen-p-la Log Analytics Workspace (LAW), which generated unnecessary costs.

By removing this redundant logging, we can reduce these costs without affecting our essential monitoring and compliance.

ðŸ“… Timeline:
This policy will be rolled out to the DTAP environment on 18 August 2025.

ðŸ“¢ Additional Info:
Thereâ€™s an internal announcement made by Mathijs Marks about this change, which you can find in the Container Community on Microsoft Teams. The link is on this slide for reference.

ðŸ“Œ Note to Customers:
If any teams still require these logs in their local LAW, they will need to enable them manually using their own rules.

âœ… Summary Points:
Policy update to Azure Diagnostic Settings

Unnecessary logs removed for cost savings

Applies to kube-audit-admin, kube-scheduler, cluster-autoscaler

Effective from 18 August 2025

Manual action required for local LAW logging
