Pod Creation is Blocked in default Namespace

Attempting to deploy a Pod directly into the default namespace results in a policy denial.

Deployment, Job, DaemonSet, StatefulSet, or ReplicaSet that would create Pods in the default namespace must also be denied.

System Resources Are Not Impacted

Kubernetes-managed resources created in the default namespace (e.g., ServiceAccount, ConfigMap, system Services) must not be denied or blocked by the policy.
