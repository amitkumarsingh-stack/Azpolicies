Azure Policy: Block Pod Deployments in the default Namespace for AKS

To strengthen workload isolation and enforce best practices in our AKS clusters, we are implementing an Azure Policy that blocks the creation of Pods specifically within the default namespace.

The default namespace is intended only for system or administrative components when no namespace is explicitly specified. Allowing application workloads to run here can lead to operational risks, reduced visibility, and policy-bypass scenarios.

We are only blocking Pod deployments in the default namespace because Kubernetes automatically creates and manages several essential resources there—such as ServiceAccount, ConfigMap, and certain system Services—that must remain unaffected for cluster functionality and stability. Restricting only Pod creation ensures that:

Application workloads cannot be deployed to the default namespace.

Existing system resources created by Kubernetes continue to function normally.

Teams are encouraged to deploy workloads into properly defined, isolated namespaces.

This policy enforces namespace hygiene while avoiding disruption of required Kubernetes system objects.
