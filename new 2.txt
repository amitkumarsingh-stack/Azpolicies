AKS auto-update can introduce unplanned changes to Kubernetes versions, node images, or components, which may lead to:

Unexpected downtime or service disruption

Compatibility issues with workloads, add-ons, or custom configurations

Reduced ability to test and validate changes before deployment

To ensure stability, reliability, and proper change management, all AKS upgrades must be performed manually and follow our standard upgrade and validation process.
