There was a CoreDNS issue in AKS 1.32 where version 1.12.0 introduced a breaking change — it stopped creating some internal DNS records, which caused lookup failures for certain pods and services. Microsoft rolled that version back and the problem was fixed upstream in CoreDNS 1.12.1. AKS 1.33 now uses the fixed version, so the issue is resolved. We just need to verify DNS resolution after upgrades, especially for clusters that might have briefly run 1.12.0
