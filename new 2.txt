We need to evaluate and document how Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM) can be used to control just-in-time (JIT) access to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for both:

AKS control plane (cluster admin / RBAC access)

Optional SSH access to AKS nodes

This spike will focus on understanding prerequisites, required configurations, limitations, and readiness for enabling PIM on existing AKS clusters.

Business Justification

Reduce standing privileged access to AKS

Improve security posture using least privilege and JIT access

Meet audit and compliance requirements

Standardize privileged access across Azure resources
