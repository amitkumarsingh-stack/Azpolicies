AKS Policy Update: Defender Enabled for D & T, Tagging Restricted to A & P
AKS Tagging Policy Revised â€“ A & P Only

Previously, in task #5405541, we added all AKS VMSS instances with the tag DisableMDC:yes, which was pushed across all DTAP environments.

Following a recent discussion with the CISO, it's been decided that Microsoft Defender should be enabled on the Development (D) and Test (T) environments, as they currently lack protection. PCC will continue to be used for the Acceptance (A) and Production (P) environments.

The following actions need to be taken:

Update the existing policy to remove the DisableMDC:yes tag from all environments.

Create a new policy and assign it only to the A and P environments. This policy should add the DisableMDC:yes tag to the AKS VMSS instances in those environments.

Notify the PET team that the updated policies have been applied to the A and P environments only.
