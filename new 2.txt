AKS Policy Update: Defender Enabled for D & T, Tagging Restricted to A & P
AKS Tagging Policy Revised â€“ A & P Only

Following recent discussions with the CISO, it has been decided that Microsoft Defender will be enabled for the D (Development) and T (Test) AKS environments, as these currently lack protection. PCC will continue to be used for the A (Acceptance) and P (Production) environments.

Below are the required actions:
- Update the existing policy to remove the DisableMDC:yes tag from all environments.
- Create a new policy that adds the DisableMDC:yes tag only to the AKS environments in A & P, and assign it accordingly.
- Notify PET that the updated policies have been applied exclusively to A & P environments.
