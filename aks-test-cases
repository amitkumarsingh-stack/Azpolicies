🔧 1. Infrastructure & Deployment Validation

 Verify AKS cluster creation completed successfully in each region

 Ensure node pools are properly configured (VM size, scaling policies)

 Confirm VNet and subnet configurations align with your network design

 Validate regional resource quotas and limits

 Check if regional Azure policies are applied (RBAC, tagging, etc.)

🌐 2. Networking & Connectivity

 Test internal and external DNS resolution

 Verify pod-to-pod, pod-to-service, and service-to-service communication

 Validate ingress controller and load balancer setup (e.g., Azure Application Gateway, NGINX)

 Test cross-region network latency (if applicable)

 Check connectivity to:

Azure resources (e.g., Key Vault, Storage, SQL, etc.)

On-prem (if hybrid)

Internet egress

🔐 3. Security & Policy Compliance

 Test Azure Policy enforcement in the new regions (e.g., allowed locations, image restrictions)

 Validate network policies (e.g., NSGs, Kubernetes network policies)

 Ensure secrets management is functioning (Key Vault integration, CSI drivers)

 Check identity and access management:

Azure AD integration

Role-based access control (RBAC)

Service accounts

📦 4. Workload Deployment & CI/CD

 Test workload deployments using your CI/CD pipeline (Dev, QA, Prod stages)

 Validate that container images pull correctly (from ACR or other registries)

 Ensure Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests work without region-specific assumptions

 Test environment variables, config maps, and secrets per region

📈 5. Monitoring, Logging & Alerts

 Confirm integration with Azure Monitor / Log Analytics

 Validate that logs from new regional clusters are visible in your central dashboard

 Test alerts for node failure, pod restarts, high memory/CPU

 Validate that Prometheus/Grafana (if used) captures metrics from the new clusters

📉 6. Failover & Resilience Testing (Optional / Advanced)

 Test if services can be re-routed or failover to another region

 Validate multi-region DNS (e.g., Traffic Manager, Front Door)

 Simulate node failure and test recovery

🔁 7. Data & Storage Validation

 Test persistent volume claims (PVC) provisioning

 Ensure compatibility with regional storage classes

 Test backup/restore strategies (if using Velero or similar)

 Validate latency or throughput of storage in the new region

📜 8. Compliance / Governance (Org-specific)

 Ensure logging meets audit requirements for the region

 Validate encryption at rest and in transit

 Confirm region-specific compliance mandates (e.g., GDPR in EU regions)

🧪 Optional: Performance Benchmarks

 Run load tests to compare performance between regions

 Test autoscaling under stress (HPA / VPA)

 Compare latency to key services (e.g., databases, APIs)
